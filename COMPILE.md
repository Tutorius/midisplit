Compilation is quite an easy task.
just use

Just call the makefile by starting 'make' in the main directory.

to compile this software on your linux-system.

Compilation on Windows with GCC as compiler should work as well. The makefile can be used there, either. Change filename after -o to midiplit.exe.

Put the resulting file (midisplit, or midisplit.exe for windows) to a directory that is included in the path so you can use it from where you need.
