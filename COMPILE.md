Compilation is quite an easy task.
just use

GCC -o midisplit midisplit.c

to compile this software on your linux-system.

Compilation on Windows with GCC as compiler should work as well

Put the resulting file (midisplit, or midisplit.exe for windows) to a directory that is included in the path so you can use it from where you need.
